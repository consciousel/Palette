# Welcome to my Dapp, Palette. 

Palette is a simple NFT minting dapp that allows anyone with an Ethereum wallet to mint a custom NFT on the Polygon network. 

The dapp allows a user to upload their NFT media/artwork to IPFS, add metadata for their asset, and mint their custom NFT. All NFTs are compatible with trading platforms like OpenSea.
